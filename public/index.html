            <p>An Arcade-style video game is one that is designed following the basic principles of the old games for Arcade machines. Its main features are a simple design and easy to assimilate controls, short and ascending levels of difficulty and minimal interruption between levels. 
            These features were originally used to keep players in the game for a short time so that they would soon have to insert more credits into the machine to challenge it again.</p>

            <p>In this way, the term "Arcade" no longer designates video game machines for living rooms, but it is also a term that is used as a genre of video games to classify games that have these distinctive characteristics. 
                The term Arcade can also be found as a very common game mode in action games for consoles, which allows you to play a simpler and faster version of the game than in the main mode or "story mode".</p>
