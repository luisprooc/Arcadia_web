            <p>An Arcade-style video game is one that is designed following the basic principles of the old games for Arcade machines. Its main features are a simple design and easy to assimilate controls, short and ascending levels of difficulty and minimal interruption between levels. 
            These features were originally used to keep players in the game for a short time so that they would soon have to insert more credits into the machine to challenge it again.</p>

            <p>In this way, the term "Arcade" no longer designates video game machines for living rooms, but it is also a term that is used as a genre of video games to classify games that have these distinctive characteristics. 
                The term Arcade can also be found as a very common game mode in action games for consoles.</p>

            <p>Galaxy Game, programmed by Bill Pitts and Hugh Tuck, is the first commercial game on record. It was installed at Stanford University in September 1971, 
            two months before the launch of Computer Space. At first only one machine was created, 
            although later some more would be manufactured and the game would be adapted to a multitude of home systems.
        </p>

        <p>
            A year later Atari was released with the PONG arcade. Nolan Bushnell located the first machine at a local gas station and when he saw how it had gone, 
            the machine was no longer working. It was completely full of coins.
            Unlike Computer Space, the PONG had a very simple handling and everyone could play and have fun from the first game.
